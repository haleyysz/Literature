# CS 546 Project - Literature
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an object-oriented design and implementation for a com-puter game called Literature1.This game uses one deck of playing cards (52 cards), modified such that the 2 card in each suitis removed, resulting in 48 cards for play. The game is played by two teams, each having threemembers. Initially, all the 48 cards are distributed to the six players. The purpose of the game isto collect all the cards in a lower suit (from 3 to 8) or upper suit (from 9 to A). When a playergets their turn, they can ask for a particular card from one of their opponents; the player needs toidentify the opponent and ask for a particular card (suit and value - example: 6 of spades). If thecalled opponent has that card, the opponent must give the card to the player and the current playergets another turn. If the opponent does not have the card, then the current player loses their turnand the turn will now shift to the opponent who was called. When a player gets all the cards in alower suit (3 to 8) or an upper suit (9 to A) in a particular suit, he/she declares the completion ofthe lower/upper suit and the team gets 1 point (for lower suits) or 2 points (for upper suits). Thegame continues until all lower and upper suits in all suits are completed.</p>
